Goal :

Pretty much everyone uses state machines as this is a rather basic but efficient design pattern that can be mixed together with others DPs. Whichever the platform (RT, FPGA, Win), an application will most likely include a state machine (or more!).

First thing : create the enum that will describe the states of the machine. Yeah well, with this QDKS, that's roughly the only thing you will need to do.

How-To :

- Copy the attached QD VI to the usual directory.

- Configure its key (S is fine !)

- Select an enum terminal or constant in your BD. Make sure there is some free space at the right of the enum.

- Ctrl+Space Ctrl+Key. You've earned a state machine corresponding to the enum items.

Hopefully this will make y'all earn some repetitive seconds...
