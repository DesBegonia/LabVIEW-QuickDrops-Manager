Follow these instructions to install and use this shortcut:
 
Save the attached VI in your <LabVIEW>\resource\dialog\QuickDrop\plugins folder.  No LabVIEW restart is required.
Select a While Loop on your diagram.
Press Ctrl-Space.
Type the desired subdiagram label text in the Quick Drop window. For the example shown above, the text "Test Label" was typed.
Press Ctrl-W.
 
Now your While Loop will have a subdiagram label with the text you specified, and formatted with the color and bolding from the image above.
 
This shortcut works in LabVIEW 2012. It is not necessary in LabVIEW 2013, since While Loop subdiagram labels are formatted like the image above (bold white text with gray background) by default.
